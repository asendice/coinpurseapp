# Coinpurse

Coinpurse is a project that allows users to create their own crypto currency portfolio and see up-to-date crypto currency statistics.
Coinpurse uses coin gecko api https://www.coingecko.com/en/api to retrieve the latest crypto currency information.
The market data is displayed and upon selecting an asset you can see more information about it:
Current price, 24h percent change, Market cap, Volume, etc.., There you can create transactions, buying or selling your assets.
The transaction process is what builds your portfolio. ex) Buy 1 BTC and now you have 1 BTC in your portfolio.
